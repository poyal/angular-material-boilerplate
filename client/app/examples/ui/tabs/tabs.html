              Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life--think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the
              brain,
              muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone.
              This is the
              way to success.

              People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they
              find a
              way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can
              even
              become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

              The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider
              them as
              believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way,
              and who
              will be sharing the adventure with them.

              You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to
              trust that
              the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life,
              karma,
              whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
